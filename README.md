# Exploring People’s Perceptions to the Ban on Women’s Education in Afghanistan
## Introduction
This research study examines the perceptions of Afghan people regarding the ban on women's education in the country. The research question focuses on the extent to which gender affects people's perception of women's access to education. The hypothesis states that women are more likely to disagree with the ban on women's education.

## Data Collection
Data was collected from Twitter using a keyword search for terms related to women's education and the ban in Afghanistan. The data set included tweets from the four largest ethnic groups in Afghanistan: Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. The total amount of data collected was 42,274 tweets.

## Data Analysis
The collected tweets were preprocessed to remove any irrelevant information and cleaned to ensure consistency in the text. Sentiment analysis was used to determine the overall sentiment of each tweet, and machine learning algorithms were used to classify the tweets based on their sentiment.

## Results
The analysis of the data revealed that the majority of the tweets expressed disagreement with the ban on women's education. The hypothesis that women are more likely to disagree with the ban was supported by the data. The sentiment analysis also revealed that there were differences in the sentiment expressed by each ethnic group, with Pashtuns expressing the most negative sentiment towards the ban.

## Discussion
The findings of this research suggest that there is widespread opposition to the ban on women's education in Afghanistan, particularly among women. The differences in sentiment expressed by different ethnic groups suggest that there are cultural factors at play that influence people's perceptions of women's education.

## Limitations
This study has several limitations, including the use of Twitter data, which may not be representative of the entire population of Afghanistan. Additionally, the study was limited to the four largest ethnic groups in Afghanistan, which may not be representative of the views of smaller ethnic groups.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this research provides insight into the perceptions of Afghan people regarding the ban on women's education in the country. The findings suggest that there is a widespread opposition to the ban, particularly among women. The results of this study can be used to inform policy decisions related to women's education in Afghanistan.
